# TheForest

A configurable website template made using Genie.jl and Stipple.jl. The template closely follows the GenieFramework and allows the creation of html pages, markdown rendering, plotting via Julia's plotly.jl and reactive julia apps. 

## Starting the website

To start the site locally, simply run the `start_repl.sh` shell script. This will start the REPL and load in the Genie app. Then typing `up()` will start a local web server with the site.
